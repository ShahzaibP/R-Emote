# R-Emote

This is my latest piece of work.
 
I use Machine Learning in a somewhat practical setting. This project involves the full development of a convolutional neural network to detect hand gestures that can control smart appliances around me. This can read hand getures, convert them to a computer-readable csv files and then train a neural network to work accordingly. It even returns an emoji for the gesture it detects, as a visual cue.

I capture my own hand getures via my webcam, capture 1500 images per gesture for a total of 8 getures. I train the model with 12000 images, and the results come out to be very accurate.

The use cases are endless. It can help technologically-challenged seniors, people who dont have the ability to speak or to do so properly for the machine to undertand, people with accents that are not well-supported by the virtual asistants, people facing some sort of disability, people with leser dexterity and people who dont have the ability to maneuver smart appliances otherwise.

I have a very large dataset for the file which github does not allow me to put up, however one can easily be generated with the code I have up here.
