# R-Emote

This is my latest piece of work.
 
I use Machine Learning jn a somewhat practical setting. This project involves the full development of a convulutional neural network to detect hand gestures that can control smart appliances around me. This can read hand getures, convert them to a computre readable csv files and then train a neural network to work accordingly. It even returns an emoji for the gesture it detects as an visula cue.

The use caes are endless. It can help technologically-challenged seniors, people ho dont have the ability to speak or to do o properly for the machine to undertand, people with accents that are not supported by the virtual asistants, people facing ome sort of disability, people with leser dexterity and people who dont have the ability to maneuver smart appliances otherwise.
