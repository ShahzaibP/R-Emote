# R-Emote

This is my latest piece of work.
 
I use Machine Learning jn a somewhat practical setting. This project involves the full development of a convolutional neural network to detect hand gestures that can control smart appliances around me. This can read hand getures, convert them to a computer-readable csv files and then train a neural network to work accordingly. It even returns an emoji for the gesture it detects as a visual cue.

I capture my own hand getures via my webcam, capture 1500 images per gesture for a total of 8 getures. I train the model with 12000 images, and the results come out to be very accurate.

The use caes are endless. It can help technologically-challenged seniors, people ho dont have the ability to speak or to do o properly for the machine to undertand, people with accents that are not supported by the virtual asistants, people facing ome sort of disability, people with leser dexterity and people who dont have the ability to maneuver smart appliances otherwise.

I have a very large dataset for the file which github does not allow me to put up, however one can be generatd with the code i have up here.
